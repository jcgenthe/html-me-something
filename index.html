                <h3>Fontbonne University</h3>
            <p>I spent the early 2000's finishing a degree in Business Administration from this small, Catholic University.
            I enjoyed my time here, and due to the small class sizes, I was able to learn a lot about the realm of Business,
            utilizing personal study and group projects.  I graduated in the spring of 2003.

                <h3>Saint Louis University</h3>
            <p>Beginning in 2015, I started a technology program in the SLU School for Professional Studies. The program was
            part of their Information Systems track, and centered on Data Analytics.  The culmination of this program was a 
            Certificate, earned after completion of 18 credit hours.  The format was entirely online, and I finished in the Fall 
            of 2016.
